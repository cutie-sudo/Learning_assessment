### Learning and Assessment CLI System Documentation
### Introduction
The Learning and Assessment CLI System is designed to streamline the process of managing instructors, students, courses, and assessments within an educational environment. By leveraging a Command-Line Interface (CLI), this system provides administrators with an easy-to-use tool to manage courses, enroll students, assign instructors, and track assessments.

The system facilitates the efficient management of educational content and student progress while ensuring data integrity through structured relationships. It enables simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, tracks relationships such as instructor-course assignments, student enrollments, and assessment results, and is scalable to accommodate future growth.

 ### Problem Statement
In many educational institutions, managing courses, instructors, and students manually or through disorganized systems such as spreadsheets can be prone to errors, inefficiency, and a lack of scalability. Challenges include:

Data Redundancy and Errors: Multiple records with the same or incorrect data.
Difficulty in Tracking Relationships: Not knowing which instructor teaches which course or which students are enrolled in a particular course.
Slow Searching and Updating: Difficulty in quickly retrieving or updating records.
Lack of Scalability: Problems in managing growing amounts of data or new features.
This system aims to address these challenges and streamline administrative tasks for educational institutions.

 ### Proposed Solution
The Learning and Assessment CLI System is a robust, scalable, and user-friendly solution that solves the problem of managing educational data. Key features include:

Structured Data Management: A centralized database to store and manage instructors, students, courses, and assessments.
CRUD Operations: Simple, intuitive functions to create, read, update, and delete instructors, students, courses, and assessments.
Relationship Tracking: Clear tracking of relationships between instructors, students, courses, and assessments.
Scalability: A flexible system that can grow as needed, accommodating future features like more detailed reports or additional assessment types.
Ease of Use: A straightforward CLI interface designed for administrators, making system management efficient and effective.

 ### Table Relationships
Instructors and Courses (One-to-Many Relationship):

Each instructor can teach multiple courses.
The Courses table has a foreign key instructor_id referencing the Instructors table.
Courses and Students (Many-to-Many Relationship):

A course can have many students enrolled, and a student can enroll in multiple courses.
This relationship is managed via a junction table, Enrollments, containing student_id and course_id.
Courses and Assessments (One-to-Many Relationship):

A course can have multiple assessments (e.g., quizzes, exams).
The Assessments table has a foreign key course_id referencing the Courses table.
Students and Assessments (Many-to-Many Relationship):

A student can take multiple assessments.
This relationship is managed via a Performance table, containing student_id and assessment_id.
